# Classify medical diagnosis with ICD-10 code

This application was built to demonstrate IBM's Watson Natural Language Classifier (NLC). The data set we will be using, [ICD-10-GT-AA.csv](data/ICD-10-GT-AA.csv), contains a subset of [ICD-10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICD-10) entries. ICD-10 is the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems. In short, it is a medical classification list by the World Health Organization (WHO) that contains codes for: diseases, signs and symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstances, and external causes of injury or diseases. Hospitals and insurance companies alike could save time and money by levearging Watson to properly tag the most accurate ICD-10 codes.

This application is a Python web application based on the [Flask microframework](http://flask.pocoo.org/), and based on earlier work done by [Ryan Anderson](https://github.com/rustyoldrake/IBM_Watson_NLC_ICD10_Health_Codes). It uses the [Watson Python SDK](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/python-sdk) to create the classifier, list classifiers, and classify the input text. We also make use of the freely available [ICD-10 API](http://icd10api.com/) which, given an ICD-10 code, returns a name and description.

## Watch the Video

Below is a video where we walkthrough NLC's tutorial. A new video will be posted soon where we walkthrough this application.
